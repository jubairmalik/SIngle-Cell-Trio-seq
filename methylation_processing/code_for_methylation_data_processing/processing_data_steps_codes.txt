#have created 3 type methylation code
#It could have been done in single code but dividided in three code as beforehand was interested only on promoter region.
As a result made three separate code to process methylation data in three ways.
#another info:  taking only 'CpG' type and excluding X,Y chromosome.

#input:removing_duplicated_final.csv (consist column for start, end and gene_name) and samples ()
#output: generate csv file with average methylation rate for each gene for each sample (total-1298 files)

#1000 position before start to start position[promoter]
methaylation_promoter.py
#Just start to end position[gene body]
methylation_genebody.py
#End postion to 500 position after end position[downstream]
methylation_downstream.py

#Those code depends on this filtered csv file where if a gene appears multiple times they are filtered away.
filtered csv file:removing_duplicated_final.csv.
previously we use 'Gene_Annotation_Reduced.csv'file which has duplicated gene rows like:
0	1	67092164	67134970	C1orf141
1	2	67092164	67134970	C1orf141
By filtering those we generated the new csv as removing_duplicated_final.csv file.

Steps inside code-
------------------------
""calculating average methylation rate in a single iteartion or single sample"":

Two input files:(example case-removing_duplicated_final.csv and .gz)

#For input file1:
To get the 'Gene_Annotation_Reduced.csv'file, we downloaded the gene annotation file from UCSC Table browser 
using genome: Human, assembly: Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38), 
group: Genes and Genes Predictions, track: NCBI Refseq filtering. The annotation file consists of columns: start,
end and gene name. Then we select the first row that will show a value of start, end and gene
name-'Gene_Annotation_Reduced.csv' which later transformed to this file removing_duplicated_final.csv

#For input file2:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE97693. From here we collected 1298 sample files.
a sample file name could be like this: GSM2697936_scTrioSeq2Met_CRC01_ML3_096.singleC.txt.gz 

#Then we pull how many times we got methylation (ranges between 0 to 1) value for each position in the aforementioned
range(promoter range,gene body range,downstream range... ranges were calculated on at a time not all together)  
from methylation value files for each sample (the file for a smple with extension .gz)


#After averaging (sum of methylation rate in that range divided by how many times that appeared), we found the average methylation rate
for that gene in that sample file (the file for a smple with extension .gz)


#Same procedure is repeated for each gene from the sample file.This is how we generated the average methylation rate for 22,910 genes. 
Then we just kept only the gene with the highest average methylation rate value if a gene appeared with multiple average methylation rate.

One output file:(example case:-GSM2697936_scTrioSeq2Met_CRC01_ML3_096.singleC_reduced.csv)
The above proceduere is repeated for 1298 smaple files which generated 1298 output files. For 3 types of methylation position the number of files will be
1298*3= 3894 files.
